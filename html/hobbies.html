            <h1>Hobbies</h1>
            <br>I have quite a few hobbies that I like to spend my time on when I'm not coding. Here they are in no particular order: 

            <br><br> 1) Knitting. I've been known to carry it around at times. I may or may not have been included in a comedian's comedy set because I was knitting. Currently, I'm knitting a large blanket that's the size of me. It's taking forever, but it's very pretty.

            <br><br> 2) Reading. I love to read. I tend to read a lot of nonfiction, generally poetry or memoirs. Last year, I read 52 books and while the number was nice, I realized that I wanted to focus on specific subjects this year. I'm trying to read 25+ books from Black Women and Non-Binary Authors, a challenge brough on by the <a href="https://www.thefreeblackwomenslibrary.com/">Free Black Women's Library</a>.

            <br><br> 3) Running. I used to hate to run. I like to say that now I just hate it less. I started working on interval running last year as a challenge and managed to increase my endurance by quite a bit. This was all thanks to the app <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/5k-runner-couch-to-5k-trainer/id448357306">Couch to 5K</a> and my best friend Soph who ran with me and cheered me all the way.
            
            <br><br> 4) Writing. I've been writing honest poetry since my early teens. Since then, it's apparently gotten better and I've started a poetry group with my best friend Soph called <a href="https://www.facebook.com/spiltredwinepoetry">Spilt Red Wine Poetry</a>. It has helped us connect others around the world and encourage honesty and vulnerability in these hard times.
